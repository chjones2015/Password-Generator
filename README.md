# Christian Jones Password Generator

## Description

This is a JavaScript code that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The code defines a string of characters that can be used in the password, and creates arrays of characters for each type (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special). It then loops through each character in the characters string and adds it to the appropriate array. The code defines a function to generate a password based on user-selected criteria. It prompts the user to select which types of characters to include in the password, and to enter the length of the password. It then generates a random password that meets the selected criteria.
